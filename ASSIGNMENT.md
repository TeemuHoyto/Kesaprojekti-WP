## Assignment - OOP2

Implement the EventInterface with the Event2 class.

Create some dummy events in `web/public/oop2.php` and print their information in a `<ul>` HTML element.

Use different time formatting for each event. For example one could print out the date in ISO 8601 format and another could print out a Finnish time format (dd.mm.yyyy HH:MM).
